Welcome to The HTML Table to Excel Sheet Converter
==================================================

Getting Started
----------------
1. Download this with the Zip Download button above
2. Unzip the files and inside, there is a file called index.html
3. Drag index.html into the latest version Chrome (preferred) or latest version of Firefox
4. Follow the instructions on the page or the directions below. I will try to keep them in sync, but if different, the one on the page takes precedence.

Directions
-------------
1. Pick the file to upload. It will automatically process your file and give you a download link above.
2. Right click the Download link and use save link as to save it.
3. Check for any weird anomalies in the sheet and correct.
4. Warning! If you are using Internet Explorer, this may not work. If you are using Firefox, you may need to remove the .part file extension. Will be fixed in future versions.

### Planned for future releases
1. Allow any amount of columns, auto-detect how many and adapt for many kinds of tables
2. Make More compatible with Mozilla Firefox
3. Ability to change names for files dynamically and separately
4. Far Future: allow many files to become one with multiple sheets
